# Volsync
This application, built with SpringBoot and the Java programming language, manages the main functionalities of Volsync.

## What is Volsync?
Volsync facilitates the interaction between organizations that are looking for volunteers for certain events/tasks and volunteers who are willing to provide that help (think Indeed, but for volunteering opportunities instead). Specifically, organizations can post different "opportunities" that correspond to the events/tasks they require volunteers for. Volunteers can then sign up for the tasks that suit their specific interests and talents. Organizations will then have the ability to accept/reject volunteers to their events in an effort to recruit the necessary talent for their events.
