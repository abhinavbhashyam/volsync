# Volsync
This application, built with SpringBoot and the Java programming language, manages the main functionalities of Volsync.

## What is Volsync?
Volsync facilitates the interaction between organizations that are looking for volunteers for certain events/tasks and volunteers who are willing to provide that help (think Indeed, but for volunteering opportunities instead). 

## Main Functionalities of Volsync
1. The application is divided into "organization" and "volunteer" accounts
2. Organizations can post different "opportunities" that correspond to the events/tasks they require volunteers for
3. Volunteers can then sign up for the tasks that suit their specific interests and talents
4. Organizations will then have the ability to accept/reject volunteers to their events in an effort to recruit the necessary talent for their events

For information regarding how these specific tasks (in addition to other functionalities like authentication/authorization using Spring Secuirty) have been implemented, please take a look at the source code. Source code has been extensively documented with Javadoc documentation.
